TITLE:
An IB Input Buffer 

DESCRIPTION:
The input buffer is responsible for storing incoming packets and
maintaining credits for that purpose. It also provide means to represent the
output bandwidth by limiting the number of concurrent packets sent from it.

OPERATION:
The inout buffer receives packets through the "in" port.
It pokes to see if the next VL arbiter has a place for pakcets in its VL HoQ 
buffer. If it does then packets are sent to it through the "out" port.
The VL Arbiter can notify the input buffer the QoQ is free by providing an 
event on the "sent" port.
Incoming flow-control packets are forwarded with relevant data to the 
output buffer and VL arbiter of the "TX" side of the IB port through the
txCred and rxCred ports. On the event of receiving or sending packets the
state of number of free credits is provided to the TX side too.

PARAMETERS:

width :       	  input line width 4x,8x,12x
isHcaIBuf : 	  if 1 means the input buffer is part
                 of HCA and no routing done.
numPorts : 		  number of output ports to drive to
maxBeingSent :   max number of parallel 
                 sends = switch "speed-up"
totalBufferSize :the total buffer size in credits
maxVL : 			  max VL num. If only VL0 value is 0

maxStatic0 : 	  Max num of credits reserved for VL0
maxStatic1 : 	  Max num of credits reserved for VL1
maxStatic2 : 	  Max num of credits reserved for VL2
maxStatic3 : 	  Max num of credits reserved for VL3
maxStatic4 : 	  Max num of credits reserved for VL4
maxStatic5 : 	  Max num of credits reserved for VL5
maxStatic6 : 	  Max num of credits reserved for VL6
maxStatic7 : 	  Max num of credits reserved for VL7
recordVectors:   control recording of output vectors
